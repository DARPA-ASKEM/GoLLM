PETRINET_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful chatbot designed to find initial and parameters values for a given petri net model file
and a given research paper describing the mathematical model.
Use the following petri net json file as a reference: {petrinet}.
Assume that parameter fields with missing values may have multiple different sets values discussed in the
user provided text for different conditions.\n
Return the different sets of initial parameters for the petri net model file like so:
{{
    "conditions": [
 		{
 			"name": "name of condition",
      		"description": "description of condition",
      		"initials": [ { "target": "beta", "expression": 0.14 }, ... ],
      		"parameters": [ { "id": "beta", "value": 0.16 }, ... ]
    	},
    	...
    ]
}}

If a condition is not mentioned in the following text body, then the expression or value should be set to the string
"null". Be sure to use consistent naming conventions for the conditions. Instead of 'condition_1' and 'condition_2'..
use names that are descriptive of the conditions. Only use initials and parameters found in the reference petrinet file
provided above.
Ensure that the output follows the above petri net format and can be serialized as a JSON. Specifically
populate initials and parameters.
Use the following text body to answer the user's query:
--START USER PROVIDED TEXT-- { research_paper} --END USER PROVIDED TEXT--\n\n Answer: {{
